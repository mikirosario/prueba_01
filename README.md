Git clone into any directory.

<strike>From the directory:
./venv/bin/python app/app.py

It uses a virtual environment.</strike>

The virtual environment is way too big to push. xD

pip install flask --user</br>
python app/app.py

It doesn't work. I didn't come into this knowing any CSS, Python, Flask or 42 Api. I just managed to cover CSS, Python and Flask basically. Couldn't figure out how to make it work with the Api in time. Sorry. :/
