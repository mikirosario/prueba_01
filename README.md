Git clone into any directory.

From the directory:
./venv/bin/python app/app.py

It uses a virtual environment.

It doesn't work. I didn't come into this knowing any CSS, Python, Flask or 42 Api. I just managed to cover CSS, Python and Flask basically. Couldn't figure out how to make it work with the Api in time. Sorry. :/
